 # AI-Powered Kitchen Ecosystem

### Topic: AI-Powered Kitchen Ecosystem for Food Waste Reduction and Nutrition Optimization
### Main Research Domain: CoEAI - Centre of Excellence for AI
### Project ID: 25-26J-351
### Repo Link: https://github.com/MethusalaKPerera/AI-POWERED-KITCHEN-ECHO-SYSTEM.git

**AI-Powered Kitchen Ecosystem** is a full-stack, research-driven platform designed to **reduce household food waste** and **optimize nutrition** by supporting the complete food lifecycle—from planning and purchasing to cooking, consumption, and waste reduction. 

This ecosystem integrates **four intelligent modules** working together in a single workflow:

1. **Spontaneous Cooking Assistant - Multi-Item Food Recognition and Recipe Discovery System** (Computer Vision + Recipe Discovery)
2. **Nutritional Guidance – Predictive Health Intervention System** (ML-based deficiency forecasting + personalized guidance)
3. **AI Shopping Agent  – Intelligent E-Commerce Recommendation System** (Voice-enabled product search + cross-platform price comparison)
4. **AI Behavioral Food Expiry Predictor – Personalized Expiry Prediction System** (Personalized spoilage/expiry prediction using user behavior feedback)

## Project Overview

Many existing food-tech applications solve problems in isolation (only recipes, only calorie counting, only shopping lists, only expiry reminders). This project unifies these areas into a **single AI-powered ecosystem** that:

- Maximizes ingredient utilization to reduce food waste
- Provides proactive nutrition guidance (not just reactive summaries)
- Supports smarter household purchasing decisions
- Learns from user habits to continuously improve predictions and recommendations

## Research Problem

Households face multiple interconnected challenges that existing food-tech solutions fail to address effectively:

- **Food Waste:** Food items are forgotten, improperly stored, or consumed too late due to the lack of adaptive expiry awareness and usage planning.
- **Poor Nutrition:** Most applications track calories or nutrients but fail to analyze user eating patterns or predict long-term micro-nutrient imbalance risks.
- **Inefficient Cooking Decisions:** Users often struggle to decide what to cook with available ingredients, leading to underutilization and waste.
- **Uninformed Shopping Behavior:** Purchasing decisions are often made without considering current inventory, nutritional needs, or price efficiency.

Current solutions operate in isolated silos, rely on static or reactive logic, and lack personalized, predictive intelligence across the complete food lifecycle.
This research addresses this gap by developing an integrated AI-powered smart kitchen ecosystem that connects cooking, nutrition guidance, shopping assistance, and food expiry management into a unified, adaptive platform.


## Research Objectives

### Main Objective
To develop an **AI-powered smart kitchen ecosystem** that reduces household food waste, improves nutrition outcomes, and enhances cooking experiences through integrated AI modules, personalization, and adaptive feedback mechanisms.

### Sub-Objectives (Module-Level)
- Recognize multiple ingredients from a single image and recommend recipes for spontaneous cooking.
- Predict micro-nutrient deficiency risk **2–weeks in advance** and provide personalized nutrition interventions.
- Provide voice-enabled smart shopping with recommendation, comparison, and search history personalization.
- Predict food expiry/spoilage dynamically using user habits, storage patterns, and feedback loops.

## System Architecture

The ecosystem follows a **modular architecture**, where each module exposes REST APIs and integrates through the main frontend experience.

**Individual Components**

**1. Spontaneous Cooking Assistant - Multi-Item Food Recognition and Recipe Discovery System**

Goal: **Turn a photo of available ingredients into recipe suggestions.**

**Key Innovations**

- Multi-item ingredient recognition (single photo → multiple detected items)
- Confidence scoring + user correction workflow
- Recipe matching and ranking based on ingredient overlap
- Missing ingredient hints and substitution suggestions

**Technical Features**

- Computer Vision + ingredient-to-recipe retrieval
- Efficient indexing/caching for fast recipe search

**2. Nutritional Guidance – Predictive Health Intervention System**

Goal: **Transform diet tracking into proactive health intervention.**

**Key Innovations**

- Predictive deficiency risk forecasting 2 weeks ahead from intake patterns
- Temporal intake analysis (weekly/monthly trends) to detect long-term imbalance
- Personalized risk scoring using user context (age/condition adjustments)
- Explainable outputs: risk indicators + summary insights for non-technical users
- Transform diet tracking into proactive health intervention

**Technical Features**

- Machine-learning–based prediction of micro-nutrient deficiency risk up to two weeks in advance
- Weekly and monthly intake trend analysis for long-term imbalance detection
- Personalized deficiency risk scoring using intake history, age requirements, and health conditions
- Risk-based nutrition insights generated from predicted deficiency levels.
- Modular ML architecture separating data aggregation, prediction, and recommendation layers
- Deficiency indicators and interpretable health summaries
- Adaptive risk recalculation with continuous intake data updates

**3. AI Shopping Agent  – Intelligent E-Commerce Recommendation System**

Goal: **Make shopping smarter, faster, and hands-free.**

**Key Features**

- Voice-based search for hands-free kitchen usage
- NLP intent understanding for smarter product matches

**4. AI Behavioral Food Expiry Predictor – Personalized Expiry Prediction System**

Goal: **Reduce waste using personalized expiry estimates.**

**Key Features**

- Learns from purchase date, storage type, and user habits
- Predicts expiry/spoilage dynamically (not just label-based)
- Feedback-based refinement (user confirms/corrects)
- Alerts and reminders for items nearing expiry

**Technical Features**

- Personalized food expiry prediction using a CatBoost regression model
- Behavior-driven learning from purchase date, storage type, and consumption history
- User feedback integration (early / on-time / late) to refine predictions
- Dynamic expiry estimation without reliance on printed expiry dates
- Sensor-free design for scalability and real-world usability
- Smart alerts for items approaching predicted expiry
